//  Common Characters
//  Write a function that accepts two strings as arguments, 
//  and returns only the characters that are common to both strings.
//  Your function should return the common characters in the same order
//  that they appear in the first argument. 
//  Ignore whitespace in your returned string. 

//  Example: commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu') 
//  Returns: 'aeiou'

commonCharacters = function(string1, string2){
